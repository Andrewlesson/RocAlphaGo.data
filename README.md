# RocAlphaGo.data

Version controlled data for the [Rochester-NRT/AlphaGo](https://github.com/Rochester-NRT/AlphaGo) repository.

`expert_play/` contains datasets of SGF files. We do not have permission to release all datasets that we are using, hence some models are trained on datasets not present in this directory

We are tracking the following:

* compressed (both `zip` and `tar.gz`) datasets of expert play SGF files
* necessary information to load and run trained models. This includes `json` files that specify model architectures and `hdf5` files for the weights.
